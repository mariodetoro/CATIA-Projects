Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of CAD projects developed across different contexts, categorized into the following folders:

📘 ETSIAE Workbook
This folder includes sketches and small models created based on exercises from the ETSIAE workbook. These projects were designed to practice and improve proficiency with CAD software.

🚀 LEEM
Contains CAD models developed for the EUROC competition as part of the LEEM team. Due to the eventual cancellation of the project, only two iterations of the speedbrakes are included, with the second version representing the final design.

🛠️ Personal CADs
A variety of personal CAD models primarily created for practice. Notably, this folder includes two larger projects:

Wing Part

Utensil
Each project includes a corresponding draft and was originally developed for college assignments.

🎨 Voluntary Individual Projects
Projects completed independently during college for Graphic Design coursework. While the original reference pieces were provided by ETSIAE professors (all rights reserved), both the final models and their drafts were entirely created by me
